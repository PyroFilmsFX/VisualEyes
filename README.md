# VisualEyes
Dug this one up from highschool. At the time I was trying to take all of the (very limited amount) CS related courses. App Development 1 & 2 happened to be a new course that year in 2016, I jumped at the opportunity. Always loved iOS from a young age.

My currently installed versions of xCode cannot compile an xCode project written in Swift 3, so this is to be continued and expanded upon once I can get my hands on an older copy. (Usually just from developer.apple.com/downloads.)

I do know this was the final project of App Dev 2. At the time I was fascinated audio visualizers, so I tried my best to learn to make one somehow. I utilized an externally compiled framework: AudioKit. 

I believe to have been proud of the A I received. Super fun course! :)
